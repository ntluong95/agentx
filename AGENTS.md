# AgentX — Agent Instructions

This repository contains the `agentx` package: the `delivery` skill and its
automation-first control protocol for coding agents, supported today on
Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor Agent CLI, and OMP.

## Source of truth

- The workflow contract is `skills/delivery/SKILL.md`.
- Settled, open, and rejected decisions are recorded in `docs/decisions.md`.
- Installation and onboarding instructions are in `README.md`.
- The closure gates below are the structural and focused test checks. There is
  no CI workflow; nothing runs on a pull request automatically.
- Live verification is `probe/checklist.md`, run by a separate agent session
  against a candidate installed from a `git archive` snapshot. When a delivery
  requires that checklist, it runs before the review dispatch, so the reviewed
  head is the verified head; if remediation changes what a worker launch does,
  the affected rows rerun before the re-review. This ordering is a project
  rule for this repository, not part of the portable protocol in `SKILL.md`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `.github/`
  (issue and pull-request templates) own the human contribution, conduct,
  security, and PR contract; they need no AgentX or Orca install to follow.

Repository artifacts are written in English.

## Workflow

- Default branch: `main`.
- Bounded or Architectural work invokes the `delivery` skill; a Spike is
  investigation only and starts no delivery run.
- Durable decisions live in `docs/decisions.md`; transient plans live in
  `docs/_plans/`.
- Maintenance logging is machine-local and opt-in at `~/.agentx/log.jsonl`
  (JSON Lines, one object per line); no project-owned log file is tracked.
  AgentX never creates `~/.agentx/`: a missing directory means nothing is
  written and nothing is created. The log records failed and abandoned
  deliveries too, which the previous format did not.
- A self-update runs its release phase through the frozen installed plugin
  version, because Control is already using it when the plan starts.
  Candidate changes in this checkout take effect for the next delivery, not
  the one shipping them. Plugin caches and any live worker hook wiring are
  refreshed only between plans.
- A delivery that changes anything under `skills/` advances the version in
  both plugin manifests, `package.json`, and the version gate below, within
  that same delivery.

## Phase dispatch

Name the model and reasoning effort on every dispatch.

<!-- agentx:begin -->
## AgentX

Bounded or Architectural work invokes `agentx:delivery`; Spike starts no
delivery run.

| Phase | Harness | Model | Effort |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `implement` | Cursor Agent CLI | cursor-grok-4.6-high | default |
| `review` | Codex CLI | gpt-5.6-sol | high |
<!-- agentx:end -->

The table is this repository's deployment selection, not the portable
protocol. Per-harness facts — status, Control wake, trust, discovery,
model and effort flag support, permission defaults, forbidden headless
forms, the instructions-file rule, and measured notes including for
deferred harnesses — live in `harnesses.json` at the repository root.

This project adds no phase-implied sandbox. Native Internet access, closure
gates, result writes and coordinator completion stay available.

## Closure gates

Run from the repository root:

```bash
git diff --check
```

```bash
jq -e . harnesses.json plugin.json .claude-plugin/plugin.json .claude-plugin/marketplace.json .codex-plugin/plugin.json .cursor-plugin/plugin.json package.json >/dev/null
```

```bash
node --check skills/delivery/scripts/agentx.js
git ls-files -z '*.sh' 'skills/delivery/scripts/agentx' | xargs -0 -n1 bash -n
```

```bash
node --test test/*.test.js
```


```bash
test "$(jq -r .version .claude-plugin/plugin.json)" = 0.23.0
test "$(jq -r .version .codex-plugin/plugin.json)" = 0.23.0
test "$(jq -r .version package.json)" = 0.23.0
```

```bash
test "$(jq -r 'has("type")' package.json)" = false
```

```bash
test ! -e skills/delivery/references/harnesses.md
```

```bash
git grep -nE 'de[l]y|De[l]y|DE[L]Y|@de[l]y|de[l]y-pin|de[l]y\.js|scripts/de[l]y|~/\.de[l]y|de[l]y@|de[l]y:' -- . ':!docs/decisions.md' ':!docs/_plans' | grep -vE '^skills/setup/SKILL.md:[0-9]+:.*<!-- de[l]y:(begin|end) -->' && exit 1 || true
```


```bash
git grep -nE 'adoptCommand|adoptedPermission|adoptPath|readAdopts|writeAdopts|recordAdopt|takeAdopt|closeAdopted|closeCreated|waitQuiet|lastOutputAt|launchKind|hasGate|GATES|pinWhy|ELECTRON|harnessCell' -- skills/ && exit 1 || true
```

```bash
git grep -Ei 'pace.?id' -- . ':!docs/_plans' && exit 1 || true
git grep -E '(^|[^A-Za-z0-9])[A-Z][0-9]+[a-z]?([^A-Za-z0-9]|$)' -- . ':!docs/_plans' && exit 1 || true
```

The first three gates prove repository shape and syntax only. A Bounded or
Architectural change to runtime behaviour must also name a focused instrument
that distinguishes the changed behaviour from its failure mode, and a change
to what a worker launch does is verified by running `probe/checklist.md`, not
by these gates.

The version gate is a literal pin. It is what keeps the two manifests from
splitting now that no workflow compares them: a `skills/` change that forgets
one manifest ships different protocol text under the same version string.

The absence command distinguishes a deleted rail from documentation that
merely says it is deleted. This delivery deleted
`skills/delivery/references/harnesses.md`; the command fails if that file
returns. The identifier grep is the same instrument applied to code: it
fails on a deletion that removes a definition and leaves a caller.

The identity grep is lexical. The only active legacy-name exception is the
setup skill's one-time migration text for old managed markers. Historical
records remain in `docs/decisions.md`.

The disclosure grep is lexical. It catches named consumer identifiers; it does
not catch a quoted consumer path, a branch name, or a session id. A green result
is not a proof of non-disclosure.
