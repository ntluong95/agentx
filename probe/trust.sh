# Act as the human for row 7 of probe/checklist.md: open the harness in an Orca
# terminal, answer its own trust dialog, and verify the answer in the harness's
# store.
#
# Usage: probe/trust.sh <repo path under ~/agentx-probe> [harness]
#
# Only `claude` is supported, because its store key is the one that has been
# measured. For any other harness, answer the dialog by hand: a script that
# reports success from the screen is worse than no script. The earlier probe
# script did exactly that, twice, while `hasTrustDialogAccepted` stayed false,
# and the delivery then failed its second preflight for the first reason.
#
# AgentX itself never answers a dialog. This is probe tooling, it is not shipped
# in the skill, and no skill references it.
