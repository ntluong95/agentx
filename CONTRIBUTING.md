# Contributing to AgentX

Thanks for your interest in improving AgentX. This guide covers the normal,
external contribution path. You do **not** need AgentX or Orca installed to
contribute here — a standard GitHub fork and pull request is enough.

## Before you start

For anything that changes a public contract (a documented command, a file
this package ships, a skill's behavior, or the repository's closure gates),
please open an issue first using the bug report or feature request form. That lets us agree on the change before you spend time on a patch, and
keeps duplicate or conflicting work from happening in parallel.

Small, obvious fixes (typos, broken links, clarified wording) don't need an
issue first — a pull request is fine.

## Making a change

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your change. Keep commits focused and write commit messages and all
   repository artifacts (docs, code comments, templates) in English.
3. Run the repository's closure gates before opening a pull request. They are
   listed in `AGENTS.md` under "Closure gates", they run from the repository
   root, and they need only `git`, `jq`, `bash` and Node on your PATH.

   If your change touches `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` or
   `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, keep both manifests' `version` fields in sync
   and equal to the version gate in `AGENTS.md` — a mismatch is a gate failure.

4. Open a pull request against `main` using the pull request template. Nothing
   runs automatically on a pull request, so say in the description which gates
   you ran and what they printed.

## Decisions

Durable design decisions and their rationale live in `docs/decisions.md`.
Maintainers own recording decisions there as part of AgentX's own delivery
process — you don't need to write a decision entry yourself, but it helps to
say in your pull request description what you expect the durable outcome to
be, so a maintainer can reconcile it.

## Review expectations

A maintainer will review your pull request, re-run the closure gates, and may
ask for changes. Changes to what a worker launch does are also checked against
`probe/checklist.md`, which is run live before a release rather than on a pull
request. Because AgentX currently has a solo maintainer, merges happen once the
gates are green and review feedback is addressed — an approving review from a
second maintainer is not required to merge.
